[*SparkFun Qwiic Dual Solid State Relay (COM-16810)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16810)

The SparkFun Qwiic Dual Solid State Relay integrates two solid state relays on to a single board allowing you to control both of them from a microcontroller via I<sup>2</sup>C with the Qwiic Ecosystem. The relays are rated for 25A @240VAC so you can control some serious power with this board. 

The Qwiic Dual Solid State Relay comes fully assembled and uses the simple [Qwiic interface](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic). No soldering, no voltage translation, no figuring out which pin is SDA or SCL, just plug and go!

**Note:** Controlling high voltage (110/220VAC) requires certain precautions. A beginner can do it but if you're wary of working with high voltage, you may want to consider the pre-made [IoT Power Relay](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14236). It's not controlled via I<sup>2</sup>C but the IoT Power Relay contains shielding to prevent accidental shock.
